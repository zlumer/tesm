# The Elm State Machine

The Elm State Machine is a state management library based on [The Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).

This library makes use of concepts familiar to Elm programmers (such as Model, Msg, Cmd) to manage application state in a totally **pure** way.

TESM is written in TypeScript. While vanilla JavaScript is supported, it is highly recommended to use TypeScript for the benefit of strict type checking.
